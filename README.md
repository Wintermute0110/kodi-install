## WARNING

Currently there is a problem when building the binary addons for Kodi Matrix with the scripts `build-binary-addons-*.sh`. I am investigating the issue and will publish a fix when ready.

## Readme me first ##

The **Kodi source directory**, the **Kodi build directory**, the **Kodi Install directory** and the **Kodi build tag**, AKA the version you want to compile, can be configured in the file `configuration.sh`.
```
# Kodi install configuration file. No trailing / in these variables.

# Kodi source directory.
KODI_SOURCE_DIR=/home/kodi/kodi-source
KODI_SOURCE_TAG=18.9-Leia
KODI_BUILD_DIR=/home/kodi/kodi-build
KODI_INSTALL_DIR=/home/kodi/kodi-bin
```

For the time being do not use spaces in the directory names and do not include a tralining `/` in the directory names. The above example is for a Linux user name `kodi` whose home directory is `/home/kodi`. Following with the example:

 * Kodi source code is located in `/home/kodi/kodi-source/`.
 
 * Kodi temporary build directory is `/home/kodi/kodi-build/`. You can safely
   delete it once Kodi has been compiled and installed.

 * Kodi will be installed in the directory `/home/kodi/kodi-bin/`.

 * Kodi user data directory is `/home/kodi/.kodi/` by default. This directory will be created automatically the first time you execute Kodi.

Once compiled and installed, you can execute Kodi in several ways:
```
$ /home/kodi/kodi-bin/bin/kodi
$ /home/kodi/kodi-bin/bin/kodi-standalone
$ /home/kodi/kodi-bin/lib/kodi/kodi-x11
```

The actual Kodi executable is `/home/kodi/kodi-bin/lib/kodi/kodi-x11`. The first two files are shell scripts that call the actual Kodi executable `kodi-x11`.

## Cloning this repository ##

If you don't have `git` installed then execute as `root` user:
```
# apt-get install git
```

To clone this repository:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/
$ git clone https://github.com/Wintermute0110/Kodi-Install.git
```

The Kodi compilation tools will be cloned into the directory 
`/home/kodi/Kodi-Install/`.


## Clone and prepare Kodi source code ##

As the `kodi` user clone the Kodi source code. This will take a while:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/
$ git clone https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.git kodi-source
```

If you want to compile a particular version of Kodi first have a look at the tags in the repository:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/kodi-source/
$ git tag
...
16.0-Jarvis
17.0-Krypton
17.6-Krypton
18.0-Leia
18.9-Leia
19.0-Matrix
19.1-Matrix
...
$ 
```

Each tag corresponds to a released version of Kodi. Now, tell `git` to set the Kodi source code to the version you want:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/kodi-source/
$ git checkout 19.1-Matrix
```

The Kodi source code is now ready for compilation.


## Compile and installing Kodi for the first time ##

First you need to install the build dependencies required to compile Kodi. As `root` execute:
```
# cd /home/kodi/Kodi-Install/
# ./install-build-dependencies-debian.sh
```

As the `kodi` user, the Kodi build directory needs to be configured before compilation:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/Kodi-Install/
$ ./configure-kodi.sh
```

Now it's time to compile Kodi. This will take a while (about 15 minutes on a fast computer):
```
$ ./build-kodi-x11.sh
```

Finally, to install Kodi, the Kodi binary addons and the required runtime files like the default skin execute:
```
$ ./install-kodi.sh
```

The first time you execute Kodi the userdata directory `/home/.kodi/` will be created.

Now that Kodi is installed you can safely delete the Kodi build directory to save disk space:
```
$ ./purge-build-directory.sh
```

Do not purge the build directory before compiling the binary addons.


## Compiling the Kodi binary addons

To compile all the binary addons:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/Kodi-Install/
$ ./build-binary-addons-all.sh
```

or instead execute this if you are not going to use Kodi personal video
recorder (PVR) features. This command compiles all binary addons except
the PVR addons:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/Kodi-Install/
$ ./build-binary-addons-no-pvr.sh
```

the binary addons are automatically installed in `/home/kodi/bin-kodi/` after compilation.


To compile the Libretro cores (Kodi addons that let you play games) first edit the file
`/home/kodi/KodiInstall/build-binary-addons-libretro-cores.sh` and comment/uncomment 
the Libretro cores you want to build. Note that building **all** the cores takes about 5/6
hours on a fast machine. Each MAME core takes 1 hour! Build only the cores you plan to use.
```
# --- Build the addons ---
# --- Uncomment the cores you want to build. Cores are shorted alphabetically.
# --- For a list of all cores see http://mirrors.kodi.tv/addons/leia/
# --- and look for the game.libretro.* addons.
# compile_core game.libretro.2048
# compile_core game.libretro.4do
compile_core game.libretro.beetle-bsnes
# compile_core game.libretro.beetle-gba
...
```

Finally, compile the Libretro cores:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/Kodi-Install/
$ ./build-binary-addons-libretro-cores.sh
```

the Libretro cores addons are automatically installed in `/home/kodi/bin-kodi/` after compilation.

## Update Kodi ##

Update Kodi source code:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/kodi-source/
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
```

If you wish to set a specific version:
```
$ git checkout 18.1-Leia
```

Then configure, compile and install Kodi again:
```
$ cd /home/kodi/Kodi-Install/
$ ./configure-kodi.sh
$ ./build-kodi-x11.sh
$ ./install-kodi.sh
$ ./build-binary-addons-no-pvr.sh
$ ./build-binary-addons-libretro-cores.sh
```

 * If you plan to update Kodi frequently then do not execute `purge-build-directory.sh` to save
   compilation time (only files changed will be recompiled).

 * If you experience problems executing `configure-kodi.sh` when re-compiling try to execute
   `purge-build-directory.sh`.

## Notes ##

 * Compiling the binary addons with `build-binary-addons-no-pvr.sh` installs them in `/home/kodi/bin-kodi/` even if Kodi has not been installed before.

 * The addons `game.controller.*` are not binary addons. They can be downloaded with the Kodi addon manager.

 * Kodi is built out-of-source but the binary addons are build inside the Kodi source.

 * Executing `build-binary-addons-no-pvr.sh` or `build-binary-addons-libretro-cores.sh` updates the binary addons source code if it has been changed?

 * After a fresh installation all the binary addons are **disabled**. They must be enabled in `Settings` -> `Addons` -> `My addons`.

 * If a Libretro core is not installed the extensions it supports are not shown in the Games source filesystem browser. Libretro core addons must installed/enabled first.


## Current bugs ##

 * If I execute any ROM I get the following dialog window "Add-on is incompatible due to unmet dependencies. Missing: game.controller.genesis.6button, game.controller.genesis.mouse"

   Kodi does not install `game.controller.*` addons automatically. Manually installing the addons solves the problem.

 * If there is no joystick plugged in then emulation does not start.

 * In the Kodi Wiki `https://kodi.wiki/view/Game_add-ons` the following `You will need to place them into the System Directory (linux example for pcsx bios files: ~/.kodi/userdata/addon_data/game.libretro.pcsx-rearmed/system/ ).` is wrong. The correct directory is `~/.kodi/userdata/addon_data/game.libretro.pcsx-rearmed/resources/system/`

 * If joystick is hot unplugged Kodi correctly detects that is has been unplugged and emulation does not start anymore. Interestingly, in Windows emulation starts when there is no gamepad, only keyboard.

```
22:46:37.511 T:140428854687488   ERROR: AddOnLog: Joystick Support: ScanEvents: failed to read joystick "Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver" on /dev/input/js0 - 19 (No such device)

```

 * If joystick is hot plugged Kodi detects it OK. Emulation starts when a ROM is clicked. Interestingly, whenever a joystick is plugged emulation starts correctly even if controlling Kodi with the keyboard.

```
22:48:47.805 T:140429205022464  NOTICE: Register - new joystick device registered on addon->peripheral.joystick/1: Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver
```

 * Aspect ratio in core `beetle_psx` is wrong in Stretch mode Normal. Stretch mode 4:3 seems to work OK.

 * I cannot use the gamepad at all in `beetle_psx`, not even after remapping the controllers `PlayStation Dual Analog` and `PlayStation Dual Shock`.

 * Core `prboom` crashes if `prboom.wad` is not found. Kodi crashes as well.

 * Speed of `prboom` core is totally wrong. Core must be run at 35 FPS, otherwise speed is wrong. This problem also happens in Retroarch. A core that does frame interpolation like **Crispy Doom** or **PrBoom+** is required.
